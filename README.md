# Alberta Aflame: Wildfire Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact and severity of wildfires in Alberta, utilizing the Historical Wildfire Dataset from the Government of Alberta for the years 2006-2021 as part of EY's Challenge in UW Data Science Club 2024 CxC Datathon. Our aim was to identify the most vulnerable areas to wildfires, the main causes behind them, and the populations most affected, with a special focus on indigenous communities.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn for visualization, we identified key factors contributing to wildfire vulnerability in Alberta.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Developed a classification model to predict wildfire size with 88% accuracy, considering variables like region, vegetation, weather conditions, etc.
- **Vulnerable Populations**: Analysis integrated with population data to highlight the impact on indigenous peoples, showcasing the disproportionate risks faced by these communities.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas
- **Data Visualization**: Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for model development, utilizing Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.

## Conclusions
Our findings underscore the significance of addressing wildfire risks, particularly in light of climate change's exacerbating effects. The project emphasizes the need for targeted support and the incorporation of indigenous knowledge in wildfire management strategies.

## Future Work
Further research will focus on the effectiveness of government actions, the allocation of resources to indigenous communities, and the influence of environmental factors on wildfire duration and severity.

## How to Use
Details on accessing the dataset, running the analysis, and implementing the machine learning model are included in the project files. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed to replicate our findings and predictions.
